### Overview
This repo, commissioned by [Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)](https://ardc.edu.au/) as part of their Community Data Labs (CDL) 2023 project, contains tutorial notebooks on how to use GeoJikuu to perform various GIS analyses. The current version includes two tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks: 
 - GeoJikuu Hot Spot Analysis Tutorial Part 1: How to Perform Hot Spot Analysis with the Getis-Ord Gi* Technique (v1.0)
 - GeoJikuu Hot Spot Analysis Tutorial Part 2: How to Perform Spacetime Hot Spot Analysis with the Getis-Ord Gi* Technique (v1.0).

These notebooks can either be cloned and run on your local machine or accessed via Nectar's BinderHub Service (see badge below).

### What is GeoJikuu?
GeoJikuu is an open-source Python library for performing geospatial analysis, with a focus on working with Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebook environments. The official website for GeoJikuu can be found here: [geojikuu.com](https://www.geojikuu.com/), and the repo for GeoJikuu can be found here: [github.com/kainedusher/GeoJikuu](https://github.com/kainedusher/GeoJikuu).


### Future Updates & Potential Improvements
 - GeoJikuu v1.0 is currently in development and is expected to be released later in 2024. This updated version will introduce additional modules as well as enhance the functionality and structure of existing ones, including those featured in this repo's notebooks. Given this, once GeoJikuu v1.0 is released, this repo will be updated to reflect the changes.
 - Alongside the release of GeoJikuu v1.0, the official website will feature improved documentation, offering more in-depth theoretical coverage of the underlying algorithms, such as Getis-Ord Gi*. This documentation will be linked to the notebooks for easy reference.
 - Although there are no immediate plans to do so, adding more preliminary tutorials to this repo would be beneficial. Since Getis-Ord Gi* hot spot analysis is an advanced topic, it would be helpful to include tutorial notebooks that provide the necessary background knowledge leading up to it.
